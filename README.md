# VXPMenu
 Custom GUI for Raspberry Pi Portable

## What is this?
 This is a GUI I created using C# Forms. It was meant to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 portable using Mono.

## Features
 • Auto-downloads patches from a specified location (Checks against last known patch filesize and the latest patch filesize)

 • Adding games or emulators is as easy as updating the settings.txt in the Resources folder

 • Minimalistic UI

 • Keyboard control (For keyboard emulation from GPIO via Adafruit's RetroGame)

 Please note that I no longer maintain this. I may come update it when I have more free time to re-build my old portable.

 Here's an image of the old portable (which I tore apart and no longer have)
